  <p>My mother loves to remind me of the impatient wails that arose every morning before my older sister went off to school. She reminds me, “Every morning you would beg me to take you to school when you were just 3 years old!” While I didn’t quite understand the concept of school at that age, my mother was convinced this made me destined to become a prodigy. The moment that supported my mother’s prophecy was when I began to piece together alphabet magnets on the refrigerator, creating simple onomatopoeias including “moo” and “boo.” Ironically enough, no one in my household spoke English fluently and I would later go into kindergarten not understanding a single word my peers were saying and keeping to myself.</p>

<p>While I could come up with several hypotheses as to why I couldn’t communicate in class, the most apparent case would be due to the fact that my parents raised me primarily speaking Farsi, the language of their homeland they cherish so dearly, Afghanistan. Both of my parents were still learning English while I was in my developmental years and according to my mother, they considered home to be the only space where they could communicate comfortably in their familiar tongue, saving their English for the next day at work. Despite my parent’s lack of proficiency in English, they had good intent in wanting to expose me to the language through playing children’s television in English, hoping I would absorb enough background information to prepare me for school. </p>

<p>The only context I knew English was through the silly cartoon shows and broken English I occasionally heard my parents speak. Early childhood development is a critical period in which children make sense of their world, particularly through the visual and auditory information they experience. Drawing on the theories made by Mikhail Bakhtin, the main proponents that are responsible for one’s speech is through the utterances of others, that is, one’s words that has previously been derived as a result of hearing it from someone else. This is a supporting definition of Bakhtin’s theory of ventriloquism, the notion that the words we communicate daily are not concretely our own, rather, “another’s discourse [striving to]  determine the very bases of our ideological interrelations with the world, the very basis of our behavior; it performs here as authoritative discourse, and an internally persuasive discourse,” (Bakhtin, 78). This plays a critical role in early childhood development as the words a child hears assimilates into their own language, creating a new basis for them to make sense of the world. </p>

<p>My limited exposure to English made it difficult to produce words in the language and as a result, I was unable to communicate in English. According to my mother, who initially thought this occurrence was due to my shy nature, I experienced difficulty internalizing English enough to actually speak it, despite eventually being able to comprehend and even spell words later in the year. By the end of kindergarten, I was still behind in phonetics and was eventually placed in my school’s supplemental speech and language program.
</p>

<p>I still recall my experiences being called out of class a couple times a week, practicing different strategies with a speech pathologist. I was told to focus on my tongue placement when enunciating sounds, like placing my tongue behind my teeth when sounding the letter “s,” and on the roof of my mouth when sounding the letter “l.” This was one of the first remarkable teaching experiences I’ve encountered as it was the most impactful, allowing me to thrive under receiving individual help. </p>
