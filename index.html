        about my community through teaching. The medium I chose to share the stories of my literacy autobiography is through building a website, a demonstration of my journey in becoming technologically literate and empowering young girls through teaching computing. I explore how my personal experiences relate to theories discussed in class and creating a website symbolizes my journey in becoming literate in a field that has become significant in my life."</p>
