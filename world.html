      <li class="line">Like most teenagers, I spent a lot of my free time on my computer. There was a particular website I was fairly active on called Tumblr, a blogging platform where I engaged in</li>
      <li class="line">what felt like another culture-—sharing “memes,” bonding with other users based on similar music/pop culture interests, and learning about being socially conscious. I owe a</li>
      <li class="line">good amount of who I am today based on Tumblr, specifically my humor, liberal beliefs, and interestingly enough, my professional career.</li>
      <li class="line"></li>
      <li class="line">As mentioned earlier, Tumblr is a blogging platform, suggesting that a user has the ability to create a blog using either premade templates or using HTML/CSS script code to</li>
      <li class="line">design their own. Tending to my curiosity one day, I selected the option to create the blog page manually with code, knowing absolutely nothing about what code even was. What I</li>
      <li class="line">was immediately met with was a variety of abstract characters, composed together to create words that had no meaning to me, but translated beautifully into images and visual</li>
      <li class="line">structures on my laptop screen. I was astonished by the way these nonsensical keywords were able to produce entire web pages and run the entire Tumblr platform. I recall</li>
      <li class="line">playing around with different keywords, immediately learning how to change the background color of my blog page and feeling excited. I thought highly of users who had</li>
      <li class="line">beautiful blog pages and recognized that code held so much power. Not only did I recognize it as a tool to build web pages, but I considered it as a tool for creativity,</li>
      <li class="line">creating visually stimulating pages and channeling one’s artistic energy.</li>
      <li class="line"></li>
      <li class="line">Up until this point of my life, I never considered myself creative. I didn’t have any desire to engage in artistic activities as the schools I attended never pushed </li>
      <li class="line">for the arts. Learning how to code and advancing my knowledge of web development was an artistic outlet I created for myself, excited to learn new things. Although</li>
      <li class="line">coding is an activity that requires analytical and critical thinking, I especially consider it to be a creative pursuit as it calls for using your ideas to solve problems</li>
      <li class="line">and design pages that are beautiful to experience. According to Paul Willis and his piece “Symbolic Creativity,” those in late developmental stages, such as </li>
      <li class="line">teenagers and young adults, are susceptible to finding and cultivating their own creativity in order to find cultural significance in their day to day life.</li>
      <li class="line">Specifically, he shares that “[they] seek to creatively establish their presence, identity, and meaning through [signs and symbols] of everyday life," (Willis, 2).</li>
      <li class="line"></li>
      <li class="line">Applying creativity to daily life and the activities one participates in is necessary to cultivate the skill of problem solving and a solution-driven mindset,</li>
      <li class="line">making creative thinking a requirement for coding. I’ve carried this way of thinking throughout studying computer science in my undergraduate career and it has </li>
      <li class="line">helped me in becoming technologically literate and tapping into my problem thinking skills, both academically and in my personal life. </li>
